# Tutorial for time-domain 2D/3D acoustic modeling
##  DESCRIPTION
This package illustrates the main features of the time-stepping modeling code
that is found under /tools/algorithms/TimeModeling
##  ON-LINE DOCUMENTATION
An overview of the results can be found in the ./doc directory and online: <br />

##  COPYRIGHT
 You may use this code only under the conditions and terms of the
 license contained in the files LICENSE or COPYING provided with this
 source code. If you do not agree to these terms you may not use this
 software.
##  PREREQUISITES

 release repositories and should be installed as necessary before using
 any of SINBAD's software.
##  INSTALLATION
Follow the instructions in the INSTALLATION file (located in the
root directory of this software release) to install all 3-rd party
software (except for MATLAB) and SINBAD's software.
###  Software in SLIM-release-apps (this) repository
 Follow the instructions in the INSTALLATION file (located in the home
 directory of this software repository) to install necessary
 components.
##  DOCUMENTATION
Documentation and examples in .html format are included in the ./doc subdirectory.
Help can also be accessed from Matlab via the `help' command.
##  RUNNING
Start matlab from this directory or run startup.m to set the correct paths. 
The scripts that produced the examples shown in the documentation can be found in ./scripts.
###  Preparing shell environment
 You must setup your shell environment according to the steps listed in
 the README located in home directory of the software release.
###  Running applications/demos
Specific instructions for each script can be found in the scripts. 
##  NOTES
##  SUPPORT
 You may contact SLIM's developers of SINBAD software via issue tracker for this repository. We do not have resources to actively support public version of our software. However, we will try to answer the questions as much as possible.
