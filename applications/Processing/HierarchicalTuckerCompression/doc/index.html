         <h1>Large-scale seismic data compression with on-the-fly shots/receivers generation from compressed Hierarchical Tucker parameter</h1>
         <introduction>
            <p>This application is available only in the software release for members of SINBAD consortium.</p>
            <p>This software provides an algorithm for fast shots/receivers extraction once representing seismic frequency slices in the
               latent Hierarchical Tucker format. It can work for both fully sampled and missing entries scenarios. The combination of massive
               compression and fast on reconstruction of 3D shot or receiver gathers leads to a substantial reduction in memory costs in
               the subsequent shot-based processings.
