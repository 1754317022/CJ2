# Missing receiver interpolation of 3D frequency slices using Hierarchical Tucker optimization.


## DESCRIPTION ##
This package illustrates the main features of 3D seismic data interpolation using the Hierachical Tucker tensor format. The scripts in these directories are the seismic examples associated to the HTOpt package, which can be found in /tools/solvers/HTOpt.
