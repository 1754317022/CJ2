##  PREREQUISITES
 All prerequisites, except for MATLAB, are provided in the software  release repositories and should be installed as necessary before using  any of SINBAD's software.

##  INSTALLATION
###  Software in SLIM-release-comp repository
 Follow the instructions in the INSTALLATION file (located in the home directory of this software repository) to install the necessary components.

##  RUNNING

###  Preparing shell environment
 You must setup your shell environment according to the steps listed in  the README located in home directory of the software release.

###  Running applications/demos
Run the edam1.m script located in SLIM-release-apps/applications/WaveformInversion/3DBasic/examples to run a simple transmission FWI experiment to demonstrate the functionality of the new modeling code. The script SLIM-release-apps/applications/WaveformInversion/3DBasic/doc/example_publishInversion.m will generate the resulting html page with results

####  Hardware requirements
* This script was tested using Matlab 2014b with the parallel computing toolbox.

##  SUPPORT
 You may contact SLIM's developers of SINBAD software via issue tracker for this repository. We do not have resources to actively support public version of our software. However, we will try to answer the questions as much as possible.
