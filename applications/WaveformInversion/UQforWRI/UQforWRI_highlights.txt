The source document for Software Highlights is composed in Latex. There are five entries needed for each section:
1. Title (one line)
2. Description (paragraphs separated the empty line)
3. References (one per line)
4. Locations for applications and/or software toolboxes (one per line)
5. BibTex (entries separated by empty line, that are missing from SLIMS's slimbib.bib)

Please, send to Henryk by e-mail the text that goes into the missing (or requiring modification) entries clearly separated, as in the example:

TITLE:
Uncertainty quantification for  2D Wavefield Reconstruction Inversion

DESCRIPTION:
This software is about uncertainty quantification for wavefield reconstruction inversion (WRI). We implement an algorithm that can quantify uncertainties in the framework of WRI.

REFERENCES:
\cite{fang2017uqfip}

LOCATIONS (in software relase directories, relative to root, that this package depends on):
The code can be found under /applications/WaveformInversion/UQforWRI/.

This package depends on the following packages:
_utilities/SPOT_ - object oriented framework for matrix-free linear algebra.
_utilities/pSPOT_ - parallel extension of SPOT.
_operators/misc_ - Misc. operators such as interpolation, smoothing and splines
_functions/misc_ - Misc. functions.
_tools/solvers/QuasiNewton/minConf_mod/_ - nonlinear optimization

Note the following:
1. If the title changes, let me know which one is to be replaced.
2. BIBTEX entries must match citations in REFERENCES, including the keys.
3. In the 'tragic' case when entire new section is needed, let me know where to put it.:-)
4. If there is more than one person responsible for missing stuff, please, coordinate and send me one version.
