#Basic full-waveform inversion.

This applications is available in the software release for both SINBAD consortium members and academic community.

##DESCRIPTION
This package contains a matlab script that reproduces the famous Camembert example [1].<br />
    An overview of the results can be found in the ./doc directory and online:<br />
